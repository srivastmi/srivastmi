### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi! :) My name is Mihir and I am a fourth year student at UCLA studying Linguistics and Computer Science. Currently I am working in the field of Cybersecurity but my other interests include natural language processing, full stack development, and exploring different areas of Computer Science. I am currently looking for a job in the computer science field.

Outside of class I enjoy teaching as part of the ACM Teach LA program and performing research with the Speech Processing and Auditory Perception Lab.

In my free time I enjoy playing saxophone (for the past 9 years), relearning gymnastics (also learning calisthenics), reading, playing video games, and as of late running.
